DESCRIPTION
    The WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes provides name, phone number and addresses
    of French telephone subscribers by using the <http://www.pagesjaunes.fr>
    directory.

METHODS
    Two classes are used in this module, a first one
    (WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes) to do the fetching and parsing, and the
    second one and a second one (WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes::Entry) holding
    the entry infos.

    Here are the methods for the main WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes module:

    new()
        The constructor accept an optional LWP::UserAgent as argument, if
        you want to provide your own.

    find( %request )
        Here are the values for the %request hash that are understood:

        nom Name of the person you're looking for.

        activite
            Professional activity of the company you're looking for. Note
            that if this field is filled, the module searches in the yellow
            pages.

        localite
            Name of the town you're searching in.

        prenom
            First name of the person you're looking for. It is not set if
            you set the 'activite' field.

        departement
            Name or number of the Département you're searching in.

    results()
        Returns an array of WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes::Entry containing the
        first matches of the query.

    has_more()
        If the query leads to more than a few results, the field has_more is
        set. You can then call the results() method again to fetch the
        datas.

    The WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes::Entry class has four methods:

    new($name, $address, $phone, $fax)
        Returns a new WWW::Search::Pagesjaunes::Entry.

    name
        Returns the name of the entry.

    address
        Returns the address of the entry.

    phone
        Returns the phone number of the entry.

    is_fax
        Returns true if the phone number is a fax one, false otherwise.

    entry
        Returns the concatenation of the name and the phone number,
        separated by " - ".

BUGS
    The phone numbers are sometimes not correctly parsed, esp. when one
    entry has several phone numbers.
